The goal of LIPES is to make extension samplers available to public. The theory is worked out in
my PhD thesis. Some examples from this thesis can be found here. Three samplers are introduced so
far. They are defined in terms of their different extensions. The extensions we consider are 
hypercube extensions, knapsack extension and the less intuitive $M_p$-extension.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LIPES from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("LinusFromm/LIPES")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(LIPES)
```
